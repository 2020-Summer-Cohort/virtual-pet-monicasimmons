# Virtual Pet Notes

I created this virtual pet game to allow a user to create a pet. First they can choose the type of animal they want to create, then they can name it.

They are immediately presented with the current status of their pet's hunger, water, and sleep levels (randomly chosen at the start). They can choose to feed, give water to, or give a nap to their pet. If they choose to feed their pet, their foodLevel will increase by 10, but their water and sleep levels will both decrease by 5. If they choose to give water to their pet, their water level will increase by 10, their food level will decrease by 2, and their sleep level will increase by 2 (as drinking more water generally gives you more energy). If you choose to give your pet a nap, their sleep level will increase by 15 and their food and water levels will both decrease by 5. 

With each action, food, water, and sleep levels will all "tick down" (decrease) by 1.

If at any point, food, water, or sleep levels drop below 50, the user will get a message indicating their pet is hungry, thirsty, or tired.

If at any point, the user wants to quit, they just have to enter 4, and they can leave the game.

With more time, I would have liked to incorporate additional features such as more things to do with your pet - play a game, read a book, go for a walk. It would also have been neat to go to a further level, so when you feed your pet, "what would you like to feed it?" with a list of 5 foods.
